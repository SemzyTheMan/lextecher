          The Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) Regulation and the revised
          Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) were adopted by the European
          Parliament in April 20, 2023, and published in the Official Journal of
          the European Union on June 9, 2023. The MiCA Regulation aims to
          establish a uniform legal framework for crypto-assets in the EU and
          enhance consumer protection. It covers the issuance and provision of
          services related to crypto-assets and stablecoins, providing a
          regulatory framework for digital assets that use Decentralized Ledger
          Technology (DLT). MICA is the EU regulation governing issuance and
          provision of services related to crypto-assets and stablecoins. MiCA
          provides a regulatory framework for digital assets that use
          decentralized ledger technology (DLT).
          <br /> MiCA is the first and only legislation of its kind in the world
          and leads the way for other jurisdictions, but it is to take effect
          around mid-2024 and early 2025. MiCA will cover crypto-assets that are
          not regulated by existing financial services legislation. The key
          provisions for those issuing and trading crypto-assets cover
          transparency, disclosure, authorization and supervision of
          transactions. Consumers would be better informed about the risks,
          costs and charges linked to their operations. In addition, the new
          legal framework will support market integrity and financial stability
          by regulating public offers of crypto assets.
          <br /> MiCA is designed as a building-block of a wider regulatory
          effort, which includes initiatives such as the Digital Operational
          Resilience Act (DORA), the DLT Pilot Regime and the Transfer of Funds
          Regulation (TFR). DORA sets standards for the development and
          maintenance of security measures in financial sector organizations and
          third parties that provide related services, such as cloud computing
          or data analysis. The DLT Pilot Regime aims to implement pilot market
          infrastructures for the issuance, trading and settlement of security
          tokens using DLT technology, and also modifies the definition of
          &quot;financial instrument&quot; under the MiFID II Directive to
          include those based on DLT technology.
        </p>
        <NumberedText text="Crypto Assets covered by MiCA " />
        <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
          MiCA defines a crypto-asset as “a digital representation of value or
          rights which may be transferred and stored electronically, using
          distributed ledger technology or similar technology.” The Regulation
          creates a distinction between ‘cryptocurrencies’ and ‘tokens’. MiCA
          also sets requirements for crypto-asset issuers and crypto-asset
          service providers (CASPs). Crypto-asset issuers must provide complete
          and transparent information about the crypto-assets they issue, and
          comply with disclosure and transparency rules. Crypto-asset service
          providers must be registered and implement security measures and
          anti-money laundering compliance.
          <br />
          <br />
          The crypto assets covered by MiCA are:
          <br />
          <br />
          1. Asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) also known as Asset-backed tokens,
          <br />
          2. Electronic money tokens (EMT), also known as Stable coins:
          <br />
          3. Crypto assets that are not considered ARTs or EMTs, such as
          ‘utility tokens,’

        <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
          The Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) is also part of the regulatory
          framework for crypto-assets and aims to establish rules for the
          transfer of funds between virtual asset service providers (VASPs). The
          TFR was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on
          June 9, 2023. Additionally, by December 30, 2024, the crypto Travel
          Rule will come into effect in the EU, requiring VASPs to obtain, hold,
          and exchange information about the originators and beneficiaries of
          virtual asset transfers to combat money laundering and terrorist
          financing. The revised TFR has removed the simplified requirements for
          transactions within the European Union. The revision aligns with the
          FATF&apos;s requirement to treat all crypto asset transfers as
          cross-border, which means there will be no distinction in the scope of
          obligations when transacting within or outside the Union. The revised
          TFR also removed the de minimis threshold (which previously was 1,000
          EUR), meaning that, once in force, EU Crypto assets service providers
          (CSPs) must comply with Travel Rule obligations which are in line with
          FATF requirements.

          The Travel Rule data requirements in the EU. According to Article 14
          of the recent legislative the proposal, the following information must
          accompany the transfers of crypto-assets: For transactions exceeding
          1,000 EUR with self-hosted wallets, European CASPs must collect the
          required originator and beneficiary information and comply with the
          following additional wallet verification obligations:
          <br />
          <br />
          i. The originator CASP must verify if the wallet is owned or
          controlled by the originator customer when sending a transfer
          exceeding 1,000 EUR,
          <br />
          ii. The beneficiary CASP must verify that the beneficiary customer
          owns or controls the originating wallet when receiving a transfer
          exceeding 1,000 EUR.

        Cryptocurrency taxation in the EU varies from country to country, where
        some charge tax on derived earnings at rates of 0 to 50%. In 2015, the
        Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that exchanges between
        traditional currency and crypto or virtual currencies should be exempt
        from VAT (value-added tax) as cryptocurrencies constitute services

      <NumberedText text="LATEST UPDATE ON MiCA" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) issued a set of
        detailed proposals on July 12, 2023, regarding how crypto companies
        within the European Union should be authorized. These proposals mark the
        first use of MiCA (Markets in Crypto-assets) regulation. The proposals
        put forth by the EU securities agencies cover various aspects of
        authorization for crypto firms. They include guidelines on how crypto
        companies should handle user complaints and manage conflicts of
        interest. The aim is to enhance consumer protection and ensure that
        crypto firms act in the best interests of their clients.
        <br />
        <br />
        ESMA&apos;s consultation also takes into account recent incidents in the
        crypto world, where some companies have misused clients&apos; funds and
        crypto-assets, and hacking attacks at crypto-asset service providers
        (CASPs) have led to significant theft of client assets. By setting out
        clear guidelines for authorization and regulation, ESMA intends to
        address such issues and increase the overall security and transparency
        of the crypto market within the EU. The consultation process started in
        July 2023, and ESMA has planned further tranches of consultations in
        October 2023, covering sustainability and record-keeping. Additionally,
        a final batch of consultations is expected in early 2024, focusing on
        issues such as when crypto-assets should be considered as securities and
        how foreign companies can serve EU clients.
        <br />
        Overall, these proposals and consultations are part of the broader
        regulatory efforts of the EU to establish a comprehensive legal
        framework for crypto-assets through MiCA. The aim is to create a uniform
        regulatory environment that ensures consumer protection, market
        integrity, and financial stability within the crypto industry.

        In the US, the lack of legal clarity surrounding digital assets and
        their classification has been a significant challenge for both
        regulators and market participants. The various regulatory bodies, such
        as the SEC, CFTC, and FinCEN, have different jurisdictions depending on
        whether a digital asset is deemed a security, commodity, or currency.{" "}

        The US Congress has defined digital assets as assets issued and
        transferred using distributed ledger or blockchain technology. From
        there, however, things get less clear. For example, digital assets can
        be securities, currencies, commodities, or property. The determination
        of which category a specific digital asset falls under is up to judicial
        interpretation, with generally the same tests applied in each case.
      </p>
      <NumberedText text="THE HOWEY TEST" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        In the US, once a digital asset is considered a security, it falls under
        the jurisdiction of the SEC and is therefore subject to the regulations
        of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities
        Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). The Howey Test, established
        through SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., has been a crucial tool for determining
        whether a digital asset is considered a security regulation. According
        to the requirements of Howey principle, a regulated investment contract
        exists when there is: an investment of money; in a common enterprise;
        with an expectation of profit; relying on the efforts of others. With
        respect to digital assets, the debate had been which of the last three
        requirements of the Howkey principles has been satisfied. For example,
        Bitcoin is not considered a security primarily due to the fact that
        there is no central third-party common enterprise. Another argument that
        has been made to avoid SEC regulation is that the tokens being offered
        are utility tokens. If the primary purpose of the token is for
        consumptive purposes, then there is not necessarily an expectation of
        profit, since the purchaser of the token has no intention of reselling
        the token. While this argument has garnered some merit, it is by no
        means a surefire way to avoid SEC regulation or to ensure a token is not
        considered a security. If a certain crypto is deemed to be a security,
        each transaction involving the crypto/token will be subject to the
        various regulations, disclosure requirements, and reporting requirements
        imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in addition to
        registering any public offering for sale of the tokens or digital
        assets. The Securities Act and Exchange Act also allows for certain
        exemptions from the registration requirements imposed on STOs and
        Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”).{" "}

        The US federal securities laws define an “exchange” as a platform that

        with the Securities Act and Exchange Act. The laws imposed by the
        Securities Act and Exchange Act require exchanges to provide investors
        with certain disclosures about the securities being offered for sale. On
        the other hand, platforms offering commodities must adhere to certain
        Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulations. Both types of
        exchanges must protect customer funds and prevent market manipulation.
        The regulations require exchanges to protect customer funds and to

      <TopText text="THE UNITED KINGDOM (UK)" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        The UK&apos;s regulatory landscape for crypto-assets involves multiple
        authorities, including the Bank of England, the Financial Conduct
        Authority (FCA), and her Majesty&apos;s Treasury (the
        &apos;Treasury&apos;). The establishment of the UK&apos;s Crypto Assets
        Taskforce in 2018 aimed to determine the appropriate regulation for
        blockchain-based businesses, while maintaining high regulatory standards
        and consumer protection. In 2020, the UK confirmed crypto assets as
        property and that cryptocurrencies such as BTC or ETH are not legal
        tender (or ‘money’) because they lack the classical definitional
        characteristics. The regulatory framework in the UK covers e-money,
        security tokens, and unregulated tokens, with the FCA being the
        authority responsible for AML and CTF compliance for crypto asset
        companies.
        <br />
        <br /> The UK&apos;s approach seeks to strike a balance between
        encouraging innovation in the crypto industry and maintaining regulatory
        oversight to safeguard consumers and market integrity. The UK also
        applies its existing regulatory framework for crypto assets which
        provide rights or obligations similar to traditional financial
        instruments. Currently only e-money and security token markets fit
        within the UK’s regulatory perimeters and can be regulated by the FCA;
        utility token markets, exchange token markets, and NFT markets are
        beyond its regulatory scope. Still, some rules still apply depending on
        the products and services. Crypto exchanges and wallets, for example,
        have to register with the FCA and comply with anti-money
        laundering/counter terrorist financing (AML/CTF) obligations. In the UK,
        Bitcoin ATMs are legal, but only if licensed or regulated by the FCA.
        Meanwhile, trading cryptocurrencies is allowed for retail investors
        except for crypto derivatives, which are capable of being financial
        instruments under UK law and hence regulated by the FCA

        In 2023, HM Treasury (HMT) published a consultation and call for
        evidence on the future financial service regulatory regime for
        crypto-assets in the UK. The HMT&apos;s Response, published on 1st
        February introduced a new definition for &quot;qualifying crypto
        asset.&quot; According to the latest proposal, a qualifying crypto asset
        is defined as &quot;any cryptographically secured digital representation
        of value or contractual rights which is fungible and
        transferable.&quot;. The newly proposed definition contains the unique
        requirement that a crypto-asset must be “fungible.” Thus, NFTs would
        therefore generally fall outside the proposed definition depending on
        their specific features.57The proposed definition, with the inclusion of
        the fungibility requirement, indicates the UK&apos;s intention to focus
        on assets that are more like traditional financial instruments with
        interchangeable units. Non-fungible tokens, being unique and not
        interchangeable, may be subject to different regulatory treatment or
        fall outside the scope of the proposed regulations.

        Part A of the Rules applies to issuers seeking to raise capital through
        digital assets offerings. Under the Rules, where digital asset offerings
        (such as Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”)) are issued to the general
        public, investors can pay for such tokens with cash, cryptocurrencies
        and other assets. Such tokens, before, they are issued to the public for
        purchase, must be registered with the SEC. Thus, Companies looking to
        issue security tokens are required to comply with the requirements of
        the Rules. These Rules are in addition to any requirements for the
        issuance of securities provided for under securities laws or any other
        rules issued by the SEC. Under the Investments and Securities Act 2007
        and the Companies and Allied Matters Act 2020, only public liability
        companies are permitted to issues securities to members of the public.
        The effect of this is that the issuers of digital assets will need to be
        public limited liability companies and not private companies.66
        <br />
        Foreign companies also wishing to offer digital assets tokens as
        securities to the public in Nigeria must also register same with the SEC
        and, in seeking to do that, the foreign company must comply with any
        other SEC regulations on offering of securities in Nigeria by foreign
        entities. Some of these requirements include: A. filing of an
        application accompanied by a draft prospectus; and B. making a sworn
        declaration that all material facts has been disclosed in the offer
        document.
        <br />
        <br />
        Concerning ML/TF risks, In 2022, Nigeria introduced a Money Laundering
        (Prevention and Prohibition) Act. The provisions of the act are in line
        with the FATF recommendations on combating the financing of terrorism
        and anti-money laundering.

        The Rules require any promoter, entity or business proposing to conduct
        digital asset offerings within Nigeria, or targeting Nigerians, to:
        <br />
        At first, submit an initial assessment form and a draft white paper to
        the SEC. These documents should contain, among other requirements,
        comprehensive information on the sustainability and scalability of the
        token and how the digital asset offering will benefit investors and
        deepen the market; detailed description of the Digital Asset, the risks
        associated with investing, the lock-up period (if any), the bonuses,
        profits, rights and privileges (monetary and non-monetary) to the buyer
        of the token, the value of each token, its technology and system
        architecture; and Legal opinion on whether or not the tokens to be sold
        through the Initial digital asset offering are securities, including
        sufficient justifications; and the minimum amount (“Soft Cap”) and
        Maximum amount (“Hard Cap”) of capital intended to be raised.
        <br />
        <br />
        The SEC reviews the initial assessment form and a draft white paper and
        informs the issuer within 35 days from the receipt of the documents on
        whether the digital asset to be offered is a security. Once the SEC
        confirms that the digital token being issued is a security, the issuer
        applies for the registration of the digital assets which the SEC may
        decide to accept or deny the application. The application is required to
        include a registration Statement containing the name, ticker, and price
        of the tokens and the number of tokens to be sold and the registration
        fees; Solicitor’s opinion confirming that all applicable permits and
        licenses for the issuance and transfer of the securities has been
        obtained; and evidence of payment of applicable fees. Upon review of the
        application for registration, if the SEC is satisfied with the
        application, it will register the digital assets securities.
      </p>
      <NumberedText text="THE INVESTMENT LIMIT" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        The SEC requires that the maximum amount of funds an issuer will be
        permitted to raise shall not be more than twenty times the issuer’s
        shareholders’ funds. Notwithstanding this threshold, the SEC prescribed
        a limit of NGN10 billion or any other limits the SEC may determine from
        time to time within a continuous 12-month period. Where the funds raised
        are below the minimum of fund budgeted for the project, it means the
        offering is unsuccessful and the issuer is to refund all monies to the
        token holders within 5 days of the offer closing date.
        <br />A retail investor is only permitted to invest a maximum of
        NGN200,000 in a digital asset offering with a total investment limit not
        exceeding NGN2 million within a 12- month period. However, the rule
        provides no limit for institutional investors.

        The 2023 Finance Act introduced a 10% capital gains tax on profits made
        from the disposal of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies,
        security tokens, and non security tokens, from May 1, 2023. However,
        Nigeria&apos;s new president, President Tinubu, issued four Executive

        It&apos;s important to note that regulatory and tax situations may

      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        As of December 15, 2022, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP),
        Japan&apos;s ruling party, decided to change the taxation rules for
        crypto companies in Japan. Under the previous taxation regime, there was
        a 30% corporate tax on crypto holdings of crypto issuing companies, even
        if the profit was only on paper and had not been realized through the
        sale. This tax on paper profit discouraged many small crypto companies
        and businesses. However, the recent decision by the LDP means that
        crypto companies in Japan will no longer have to pay tax on paper
        profits. This change is likely to be welcomed by the crypto industry in
        Japan as it removes a significant financial burden and could encourage
        more growth and investment in the sector.73It is important to note that
        taxation policies can be subject to change, and it&apos;s advisable for
        businesses and individuals involved in the crypto industry in Japan to
        keep abreast of any further developments in tax regulations to ensure
        compliance with the law.

      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        On a national level, although cryptocurrencies are legal in Germany,
        they are not considered legal tender or currency. Instead, regulators
        classify cryptocurrencies as a financial instrument or asset, which
        makes them subject to regulations and laws related to securities and
        investments. In 2013, the German Ministry of Finance issued a statement
        recognizing bitcoin as a “unit of account” that can be used for tax and
        trading purposes. Cryptocurrency trading and exchanges in Germany are
        regulated by Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), which
        passed a law in 2020 requiring all cryptocurrency exchanges operating in
        Germany to be licensed to comply with KYC and AML regulations. This law
        also established rules for crypto custodians, including the requirement
        to hold a minimum amount of capital and ensure compliance with
        Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. Cryptocurrency in Germany is
        subject to capital gains tax if it has been held for less than a year
        before being sold or traded. However, if the digital asset is held for
        longer, it is exempted. Profits from cryptocurrency mining are subject
        to income tax, if the cryptocurrency is used to purchase services or
        goods, it may be subject to VAT. Profits from cryptocurrencies of less
        than €600 per year are tax-free. There is also an exemption limit of
        €256 per year for income from staking or lending.76 German tax residents
        are required to report their cryptocurrency transactions, including
        purchases, sales and exchanges, for tax purposes. Failure to do so may
        result in fines. Cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers must
        also report any suspicious activity to the Financial Intelligence Unit
        (FIU).

      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        El Salvador has also introduced a “golden visa” program, which allows
        foreign investors who invest a certain amount of money in the country to
        obtain a visa and residency permit. The program includes provisions for
        investment in cryptocurrency and blockchain-related projects, which
        could further help to attract cryptocurrency businesses and
        entrepreneurs to the country. El Salvador’s embrace of cryptocurrency
        and blockchain technology, as well as its supportive regulatory
        environment and relatively low tax rates, make it an attractive place
        for cryptocurrency businesses and investors. Indeed, El Salvador&apos;s
        Bitcoin Law, passed in June 2021, made it the first country in the world
        to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender, allowing it to be used for
        transactions alongside the official currency, the US Dollar. The law
        aims to promote financial inclusion and innovation, especially in a
        country with a large unbanked population. The law also imposes specific
        financial compliance restrictions on Bitcoin service providers, treating
        them similarly to traditional financial institutions. These providers,
        including wallets, exchanges, protectors, and payment processors, are
        required to register with the Central Bank of El Salvador and adhere to
        various regulatory criteria, such as implementing an AML/CFT plan,
        maintaining transaction records, and having cybersecurity measures in
        place. Additionally, El Salvador&apos;s introduction of a &quot;golden
        visa&quot; program that includes provisions for investment in
        cryptocurrency and blockchain-related projects further demonstrates its
        commitment to attract cryptocurrency businesses and entrepreneurs to the
        country. The supportive regulatory environment and relatively low tax
        rates in El Salvador have made it an attractive destination for
        cryptocurrency businesses and investors seeking a favorable climate for
        their operations. However, it is important to note that cryptocurrency
        regulations and policies can evolve, and interested parties should stay
        informed about any updates or changes to the laws and regulations in El

        As can be gleaned from the recommendations and regulations discussed
        above, it is clear that cryptocurrencies are recognized as
        &apos;Assets&apos; in most jurisdictions, with only a few countries
        recognizing cryptocurrencies as legal tender. Also, in terms of
        regulatory provisions, the types of Crypto/Virtual/Digital assets
        (depending on the nomenclature different jurisdictions have used)
        recognized in each jurisdiction are based on the regulatory provisions
        of that particular jurisdiction. There are certain cryptocurrencies that
        don&apos;t even enjoy a dime of regulatory protection, such as the
        Privacy tokens and DEFI tokens, etc. Most of the existing regulations
        seem to focus on cryptocurrencies like Asset-backed tokens, Security
        tokens, and Stablecoins (which are different from central bank-backed
        tokens). Furthermore, the digital representation of a country&apos;s
        fiat is not categorized as a cryptocurrency based on the recommendations
        of the multinational regulatory bodies.

      <TopText text="CONCLUSION" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        Most cryptocurrencies have been deemed to be high risk, although they
        are very attractive in terms of investments and transaction benefits.
        Amongst other crimes that have been and can be perpetuated through the
        use of cryptocurrencies include money laundering (ML), the sale of
        controlled substances and other illegal items (e.g., prohibited drugs
        and food items), fraud, tax evasion, cyberattacks like crypto jacking,
        child exploitation, human trafficking, and terrorist financing (TF).
        These crimes have led global regulatory bodies like FATF and OECD, as
        well as the local regulatory bodies of various jurisdictions, to enact
        laws to regulate cryptocurrencies. To a large extent, and as expected,
        the regulations seem to be focused on protecting investors and third
        parties against the risks associated with cryptocurrencies. A noticeable
        trend in regulation shows that the focus is on cryptocurrencies that
        have underlying tangible and intangible properties (e.g. debts). It also
        cannot be ignored that regulations support the categorization of
        cryptocurrencies as &apos;assets&apos; rather than as &apos;legal
        tender&apos; or &apos;currency&apos;, except in a few jurisdictions like
        El Salvador and Japan. Additionally, regulations, like those of the EU,
        have differentiated central bank digital currencies from stablecoins.
        Finally, regulations have provided guidance to the general public about
        the types of cryptocurrencies to look out for in order not to fall
        victim to the risks involved in cryptocurrencies.
