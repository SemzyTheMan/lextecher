        Today, almost everyone aspires to be tech-savvy, especially with the
        digital innovations heating up our world. There has simultaneously
        arisen a need to examine not only the law as it is, but also as it
        should be, in light of the reality that our world is becoming
        increasingly digitised. This is particularly important in the context of
        the AI-metaverse relationship, where the law must enlighten people who
        are ignorant of the legal implications of interacting with these
        innovations. Through qualitative research of extant laws common in
        almost every legal system that regulate daily activities in the physical
        world, this paper aims to provide enlightenment to the average person on
        the presence of the law and the legal implications in the AI-metaverse
        relationship. The research examines relevant laws on legal disciplines,
        such as contract law and commercial transaction law, criminal law,
        intellectual property law, insurance law, taxation, deceptive designs
        and dark patterns policy, cross-border laws, and a few others.
        <br />
        <br /> At the end of this article, it will be evident that the law is
        indispensable in the &quot;AI-metaverse relationship&quot;. However,
        many of these laws need to be updated to effectively regulate the
        non-conventional nature of the virtual world.

      <TopText text="INTRODUCTION" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        The Metaverse is the next itinerary of the internet, which has created
        an avenue for people to recreate their daily activities such as buying
        real estate, holding court sessions, working, attending classes, and
        commemorating marriages. The role of AI in bringing these functions to
        life cannot be overestimated. However, laws, rules, regulations, and
        guidelines also play a huge role in regulating human conduct in this
        space and eradicating anarchy. It is important to ensure that these laws
        keep up with advancements in technology and are able to address issues
        unique to the Metaverse. As the Metaverse becomes more prevalent in our
        daily lives, it is crucial that we have a clear and effective legal
        framework in place to govern our actions and interactions within the
        virtual world. This will enable us to fully harness the potential
        benefits of the Metaverse, while also ensuring the safety and well-being
        of its users.

      <TopText text="ANATOMY OF THE METAVERSE" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        There exist multiple definitions of the term metaverse. However, as
        deduced from its name, it is a combination of two words ‘Meta’ and
        ‘Verse&apos;. Meta comes from the Greek prefix meta, which means
        “after&apos;&apos; or “beyond”, on the other hand verse means “world or
        sphere or creation”. In essence, Metaverse means beyond the physical
        world or the physical creation or the physical sphere.
        <br />
        <br />
        The word Metaverse was first mentioned in Neal Stephenson&apos;s 1992
        science fiction novel, Snow Crash. Today, the Metaverse is a set of
        digital experiences that utilizes technologies such as blockchain, VR
        (Virtual Reality) devices, AR (Augmented Reality) devices, 5G, cloud
        computing and IOTs (Internet of things). Over 160 companies are
        currently developing their Metaverse platforms, with some of the most
        popular ones being Sandbox, Decentral, and Roblox. The Metaverse is
        interoperable and not device dependent, meaning that avatars can move
        from one platform to another without using a specific device. The
        Metaverse is a scalable ecosystem that enables business owners to
        provide specialized digital items, and the hardware layer includes human
        interfacing which allows a person&apos;s body to be represented as a 3D
        avatar.
        <br />
        <br />
        The immersive metaverse experience will allow customers to create
        digital worlds by simulating the real world. The Metaverse may be
        centralized or decentralized, the decentralized metaverse are ruled
        through governance. The Scalable ecosystems will support business owners
        in providing a more comprehensive range of specialized digital items as
        the Metaverse expands, enabled by blockchain technology. Any virtual
        world can accept a person’s body as a 3D (realistic) avatar. The
        Metaverse offers a wide range of opportunities including virtual
        mountain climbing, virtual shopping, manufacturing, travelling and
        virtual creation of content. It is a great tool for education, provision
        of virtual factories, and building immersive experiences for events and
        travel. Additionally, it can benefit the medical field by providing
        virtual training for surgical procedures and remote healthcare. For
        workplaces, the Metaverse can provide digital workspaces and improve
        communication. While still in its early stages, the Metaverse has the
        potential to revolutionize various aspects of daily life.

      <TopText text="THE APPLICATION OF LAW IN THE METAVERSE" />
      <p>
        In the section, we shall analyze some relevant aspects of law and their
        application in the AI- metaverse relationship.
      </p>
      <NumberedText
        text={" 1. Contract Law and Law of Commercial Transactions".toUpperCase()}
      />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        The major question here is whether the laws of Contract and commercial
        transactions would apply to contracts and transactions taking place in
        the metaverse
        <br />
        Black&apos;s Law Dictionary defines a contract as an agreement between
        two or more parties that creates obligations enforceable or otherwise
        recognized under the law. For a contract to be valid, it must include
        offer, acceptance, capacity of the parties, consensus ad idem (consent
        of the parties), and intention to enter a legal relationship.
        <br />
        However, many problems may arise during and after the time parties enter
        into a contract. These may include breach of contract by one of the
        parties, incapacity of the parties or a party to the contract, duress
        and undue influence, unconscionable bargains, fraud, misstatements, and
        misrepresentations. Law of commercial transactions include, the market
        overt law, the law on fitness for purpose, merchantable quality,
        warranties and conditions, among others. It&apos;s important to consider
        these laws when conducting business transactions in the physical and the
        virtual world, but in the Metaverse the application of these laws might
        be limited as users are typically prompted to sign a set of terms and
        conditions when they sign up to a platform, this regulates the use of
        the platform and determine the user&apos;s legal rights and the
        procedure for resolving disputes. This agreement is usually with the
        centralized entity. In the case of decentralized platforms, it is
        essential that the user reads the terms and conditions provided by a
        metaverse platform before opting to join the metaverse. It is important
        to mention that the terms and conditions provided by these metaverse
        platforms constitute an offer, and by accepting to go into these
        metaverse platforms you have accepted that offer, thereby creating a
        contract between you and the platform
        <br />
        <br />
        Another question is, what if you have an issue with a metaverse platform
        where and who do you sue, especially when the metaverse platform is
        decentralized (with no central authority)? What would be needed here is
        to make sure to read the terms and conditions well before entering into
        the metaverse, the terms and conditions could provide instructions on
        the place to sue and whom to sue when a problem arises. It is
        recommended that a user (avatar) entering into contracts with other
        users (avatars) should take advantage of the principle of Freedom of
        Contract to determine the applicable laws that would govern their
        contract, in case the contract goes wrong. If it is a transaction
        involving companies, there should also be an agreement clause providing
        an avenue for customers to report issues and a hint on how to take other
        appropriate actions when needed
        <br />
        Even with that, can contracts and transactions carried out in the
        metaverse be considered “legal”? What if the domicile of the user or
        company or the country of the applicable law chosen by the parties
        (unknown to the parties) does not legally recognize the contracts and
        transactions carried out in the metaverse? This would then be an issue,
        as nations have sovereignty in the virtual world. The good news is that
        contract law and law of commercial transactions are mostly uniform or
        similar among nations.
      </p>
      <NumberedText text={"Intellectual Property Law".toUpperCase()} />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        According to the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO),
        intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as
        inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, and symbols, names and
        images used in commerce, works of authorship, inventions, and
        improvements on existing works or inventions that are new. If you create
        such a work or invention, you have intellectual property rights in that
        work. Intellectual property law protects both creators and their
        creations morally and financially. Primarily, intellectual property
        rights encourage more innovative works and protect the exploitation of
        people’s works. Some of the Intellectual property laws include
        Copyright, Trademarks, trade secret, patent, geographical indications,
        and industrial designs. Intellectual property theft or infringement
        occurs when someone takes another person&apos;s work or invention and
        presents it as their own without the permission of the true owner. This
        is because the original owner has the exclusive right to use, reproduce,
        or distribute their work or invention, and anyone who does so without
        permission is violating their intellectual property rights. Some
        instances of IP infringements in the metaverse include, sale of an NFT
        under the guise of popular NFT work, patent infringement in production
        of the hardware associated with Metaverse, misappropriation of trade
        secrets as well as passing off a competitor’s trademark across the
        virtual space. Furthermore, the content shared and created by the users
        in the Metaverse, due to its easy accessibility is susceptible to
        copyright infringement. At this juncture, we shall proceed to briefly
        discuss the types of intellectual property rights and their
        applicability in the metaverse.
      </p>
      <ItalicText text="Copyright" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        WIPO defines Copyright to be a legal term used to describe the rights
        that creators have over their literary and artistic works. Works covered
        by copyright range from books, music, paintings, sculpture and films, to
        computer programs, databases, advertisements, maps and technical
        drawings. A copyright accrues automatically and doesn&apos;t require
        registration for the protection to vest. The most common copyrights
        relating to Metaverse are the software applications aiding the creation
        of the Metaverse. Since such virtual worlds are a combination of various
        musical, artistic, literary, sound, and drama works, copyright claims
        are also made separately as such. Since an infinite number of creations
        are possible within the Metaverse, there already exist copyright
        infringement claims in the Metaverse.
        <br /> In the case of{" "}
        <span>Amaretto Ranch Breedables, LLC Vs Ozimals, Inc</span> , there was
        a takedown notice dispute between companies that produce virtual animals
        on Second Life. The Ozimal developed ‘breedable animals’ within the
        ‘Second Life’ Metaverse, the plaintiff claimed that the defendants by
        developing ‘virtual bunnies’ had infringed upon their copyright of a
        &apos;virtual horse’ created within the Metaverse. The court eventually
        dismissed both claims.

      </div>
      <ItalicText text="Patent" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        WIPO defines patent as an exclusive right granted for an invention.
        Generally speaking, a patent provides the patent owner with the right to
        decide how orwhether the invention can be used by others. In exchange
        for this right, the patent owner makes technical information about the
        invention publicly available in the published patent document.
        <br />A patent is the part of Intellectual Property law that protects
        innovations. In patents, the protection covers the processes and
        functions of an innovation or invention. A patent is granted for a term
        of years and is renewable. For an invention to be patented it must be
        registered and the required financial obligations must be met.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the Metaverse, these components require patent;
      </p>
      <ul className={`${styles.UnorderedListContainer} ${styles.NoPadding}`}>
        <li>
          Patent of Metaverse technology and AI, which itself can be divided
          into hardware & software technologies needed for building a custom &
          unique Metaverse.
        </li>
        <li>
          Already existing patented technologies and machines were used within
          the Metaverse in their virtual form. This is known as the
          ‘Virtualization of patents’, which could be an infringement of the
          patented physical form.
        </li>
        <li>Patents created by avatars and companies within Metaverse.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className={`${styles.Text} mt-[2rem]`}>
        Companies developing metaverse-related technologies must protect their
        inventions through patents. Currently, the majority of the
        metaverse-related patents are either in the VR (Virtual Reality) or AR
        (Augmented Reality) space.
      </p>
      <ItalicText text="Trademark" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        WIPO defines a trademark as a sign capable of distinguishing the goods
        or services of one enterprise from those of another. Trade mark includes
        words, marks, symbols, colours, and even the sound employed by a company
        to distinguish its business from others.
        <br />
        Just because a brand in the physical world hasn&apos;t established a
        presence in the Metaverse, it doesn&apos;t mean its trademark can be
        used by another brand in the virtual world, this still counts as
        trademark infringement. As long as it confuses the user, by causing the
        user to think the infringing brand is the same as the original, then
        there is trademark infringement.
        <br />
        The exception is where the same trademark is used in different
        categories of products. For example, if the original trademark was
        registered under the fashion category and another brand uses the same
        trademark but under the building and construction category, then it
        would not be considered as trademark infringement. It has been suggested
        that trademarks in the Metaverse will likely be non-traditional (such as
        moving image marks or sound marks), which will lead to an increase in
        the volume of protection afforded to such non-traditional trademarks.
        However, using a trademark consistently while conducting business in the
        metaverse can create acquired distinctiveness, which can make a
        non-traditional trademark registrable.
      </p>
      <ItalicText text="Industrial design" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        WIPO defined an industrial design to constitute the ornamental or
        aesthetic aspect of an article. A design may consist of
        three-dimensional features, such as the shape or surface of an article,
        or of two-dimensional features, such as patterns, lines or color. This
        type of IP provides an exclusive right in novel aspects of the
        appearance of an article.
        <br /> A design must be registered to enjoy the protection. The design
        of items and products in the metaverse can be protected, because they
        would be in 3D, as well as in 2D form. These registered design rights
        are useful in the metaverse. For example, where a brand has a design
        registration for a popular handbag, if this is adopted by a digital
        avatar, then the registration could be enforced against a copycat
        digital embodiment.
      </p>
      <ItalicText text="Geographical indications" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        WIPO also defines geographical indications and appellations of origin as
        signs used on goods that have a specific geographical origin and possess
        qualities, a reputation or characteristics that are essentially
        attributable to that place of origin. Most commonly, a geographical
        indication includes the name of the place of origin of the goods. Since
        the metaverse is a virtual representation of the real world, products
        and goods sold in the metaverse would still very much maintain their
        geographical significance.
      </p>
      <ItalicText text="Trade Secrets" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        WIPO defines trade secrets as IP rights on confidential information
        which may be sold or licensed. The unauthorized acquisition, use or
        disclosure of such secret information in a manner contrary to honest
        commercial practices by others is regarded as an unfair practice and a
        violation of the trade secret protection. This right is equally enjoyed
        by employers both in the physical world and in the metaverse.
        <br /> There are fears that AI and the metaverse are a great tool to
        encourage Intellectual Property theft. The following are great ways to
        ensure your intellectual property rights are protected:

      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        Insurance contract is a contract where one party (the insurance company)
        agrees to indemnify the other party (the insured) for a risk that could
        occur to the subject matter of the agreement, in exchange for a premium
        from the other party (insured). Insurance involves the distribution of
        loss and not the prevention of loss, and it is divided into life and
        general insurance. It is uncertain whether traditional general insurance
        covers would apply in the metaverse since there may not be a need for
        burglary or fire insurance. However, digital assets could be insured
        under property insurance, also AI-related incidents, hacking, and
        cyber-attacks in the virtual world could be insured against. Life
        insurance could apply to cover users (avatars) receiving medical
        services in the metaverse, but the need for insurance in the metaverse
        would generally depend on policies and regulations from different
        countries.
