      <NumberedText text="4 TORT" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        A tort refers to a civil wrong committed against a person or property,
        independent of a contract. According to
        <span>Black&apos;s Law Dictionary</span> , a tort can be either a direct
        violation of an individual&apos;s legal right, the breach of a public
        duty resulting in special damages to an individual, or the violation of
        a private obligation resulting in similar damages to an individual. In
        the first case, no special damages are required for the party to claim
        recovery, whereas such damages are essential in the latter two cases.
        Essentially, tort law embodies the principle of &quot;love your
        neighbour as yourself.“ In the realm of law, torts encompasses a wide
        range of wrongdoings, including trespass, assault, battery, negligence,
        products liability, intentional infliction of emotional distress,
        nuisance, defamation, invasion of privacy, false imprisonment, and
        economic torts such as passing-off, malice, and breach of contract.
        While the nature of torts committed in the metaverse would not involve
        physical harm to individuals or property, they could result in mental
        distress, with cyberbullying serving as a prime example. As such,
        individuals who experience virtual assault or violence should be able to
        take legal action and sue for damages against the responsible party.
        However, identifying and capturing the perpetrator behind a violent
        avatar in the metaverse can be a challenging task, especially in
        decentralised environments. The use of AI may offer some potential
        solutions, but it may not be fool proof as a person can change avatars.
        Therefore, it is crucial to focus on prevention measures. Meta, one of
        the companies building a metaverse, has taken a commendable step by
        implementing a safe boundary of 4 feet (around 1.2 metres) between
        avatars in its metaverse. Such safeguards must be incorporated by
        developers as they build the metaverse to prevent it from becoming a hub
        of anarchy.

      <NumberedText text="5. CRIMINAL LAW" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        <span> Black&apos;s law Dictionary</span> defines a crime as an act
        committed or omitted, in violation of a public law, either forbidding or
        commanding it; a breach or violation of some public right or duty due to
        a whole community, in its social aggregate capacity, as distinguished
        from a civil injury. Traditionally, an act is considered a crime only if
        it has a direct impact on the physical world - through hard harms (e.g.
        physical harm on a victim or a property) or certain soft harms, mainly
        those that harm morality (e.g. gambling, and prostitution). Other forms
        may include, crimes that inflict emotional harm or harm to one&apos;s
        reputation (e.g. stalking, and libel), and crimes that inflict
        systematic harm (e.g. formation of a monopoly, which discourages market
        competition).
        <br />
        <br /> In light of the above, can violence occurring in the Metaverse be
        considered and treated as crimes? Can a crime committed by a human
        avatar be prosecuted and punished?
        <br /> It has been accepted that there are virtual crimes, and that
        these virtual crimes can be as adverse as physical crimes. As such,
        virtual crimes should be treated the same way and with the same trials
        and punishments as physical crimes. Also, can an AI avatar be a
        perpetrator or a victim? If this is answered in the negative, it would
        then nullify the criminal nature of many acts. Thus, let us consider
        some classifications wherein AI avatars can perpetuate criminal acts:
        Classifying an AI avatar as a victim of permanent damage or destruction
        seems reasonable, although the AI avatar acts independently of the
        manufacturer. But classifying an AI avatar as a victim of crimes that
        inflict purely emotional damage (e.g. virtual rape) seems less
        reasonable if it cannot ‘feel’ like humans, and has no psychological
        needs.
        <br /> In cases where an AI avatar ‘learns’ on its own how to commit a
        crime or if an offending AI avatar is controlled by a human, or where
        the incident is caused by a defect in the design of the offending AI
        avatar (e.g. a bug), should the manufacturer be held responsible?.
        <br />
        <br /> It is believed that if the AI avatar&apos;s act of violence was
        caused by a malfunction  in its software or a hacking activity, it would
        be unfair to punish the manufacturer  for the AI avatar&apos;s actions.
        AI programs are becoming more complex and  unpredictable, thus treating
        AI avatars as legal persons could facilitate certain  penalties, such as
        a ban. Therefore, it is believed that AI avatars should be  indicted
        like human avatars.  <br />
        The toughest problem with crimes in the metaverse will be how to nab
        and  prosecute people behind offending avatars in real life effectively.
        Banning users  can be useful, but it’s very easy for them to come back
        under another pseudo  Avatar. Online criminals have clever ways to
        conceal themselves from other  users, and it may be extremely difficult
        for them to be caught. For example, with  the development of NFTs, theft
        of virtual objects is now possible. Of course,  NFTs can be tracked, so
        if someone steals one, it can be traced to their virtual  wallet.
        However, hackers know how to cover their tracks and hide what they have 
        stolen, making it hard to prove where it’s gone and who now has it.
        <br />  As a means to an end, Digital Forensic could come in handy.
        Digital forensics is  the virtual reconstruction of crimes committed in
        the real world, which supports  investigations of digital crimes. A
        major way to investigate crimes in the  metaverse is through images and
        videos. The disadvantage is that due to the high  interoperability and
        variation of the virtual world, forensics investigation could  be
        challenging.  There has been a distinction between crimes in the
        metaverse, such as  cybercrimes (acts already punishable by law) and
        fantasy crimes (acts that are  usually not criminalised).
        <br />  Cybercrimes are generally defined as acts committed through
        information and  communication technologies that violate the law of the
        physical world. These  include representative acts such as identity
        theft, online harassment, financial  fraud, cyber extortion crimes, and
        theft of virtual property with ‘real’ monetary  value. Despite a general
        agreement on some of these crimes, there is a lack of  consensus among
        countries on whether specific acts constitute cyber- crimes. “Fantasy
        Crimes” on the other hand, for example, include money laundering 
        through the metaverse. An estimation suggests that 8.6 billion dollars
        of  cryptocurrency has been laundered in 2021. There are fears that this
        trend could  continue, especially because the decentralised economy and
        anonymity makes  funds less traceable. 
        <br /> Some countries have recently taken the initiative in including
        NFTs as part of  their anti-money laundering laws. Specifically, in June
        2022, the European Union  agreed on anti-money laundering rules.

        The vulnerability of the users in the metaverse demands a discussion of
        the rules, regulations or laws that should be implemented in these
        virtual worlds:
      </p>
      <ul className={`${styles.UnorderedListContainer} ${styles.NoPadding}`}>
        <li>
          It is suggested that the way crime is viewed should be revisited,
          including the expansion of the scope of punitive actions, and
          identifying the users in the Metaverse that would have to incur
          liability. The first approach would be a complete review of the
          current schools of thought about criminal law and jurisdiction.
          Identification of victims and perpetrators should include AI avatars
          and liability should be imposed on them.
        </li>
        <li>
          There should be a formation of regulatory penal laws of the exact
          nature and scope of international laws. This would create a legal
          infrastructure that reinforces state sovereignty rather than
          empowering a more global, transnational approach to solving problems
          and punishing wrongdoers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Thirdly, the criminal legislation process should be decentralised by
          empowering the metaverse platforms with regulatory powers. This
          approach is suggestive of the future, as the revisiting of existing
          laws pertaining to technology will interlink itself with a
          platform&apos;s Terms and Conditions of Service. These regulations
          will acknowledge that criminal jurisdiction is intrinsically connected
          to state recognition and state sanctioned liabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          The desire to regulate the metaverse to make it safe for everyone
          involved may also go against some of its biggest advantages which is
          decentralization. The decentralised nature of the metaverse is good,
          but the need to prosecute cyber criminals and protect virtual property
          might mean that centralisation cannot be avoided. How much of a
          negative effect this might have on people’s desire to join the
          metaverse is yet to be seen but it could certainly deter some.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className={`${styles.Text} mt-[2rem]`}>
        These approaches mentioned above have their own flaws. With the advent
        of the metaverse there will be a need to review and reconstruct criminal
        jurisprudence. Also, the principle of universal jurisdiction could be a
        vital point to begin the identification of laws that should apply to the
        metaverse.
      </p>
      <NumberedText text="6. TAXATION REGULATIONS" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        In a general sense, a tax is any contribution imposed by the government
        upon individuals and companies, for the use and service of the state/
        country. Major policy makers in the world are working on new tax rules
        and laws for the metaverse and the digital assets often used in it.
        Though transactions may take place in the virtual world, metaverse users
        will likely still face real-world tax liabilities. Taxes are incurred
        based on the physical location of the taxpayer. So, if a person is
        actively involved in creating and selling NFTs as a livelihood, there is
        no question that the proceeds from those sales constitute income, and
        should therefore be taxed. Buying NFTs with cryptocurrency and selling
        NFTs are considered disposals subject to tax. NFTs are the tokenized
        form of assets in the Metaverse.
        <br />
        <br />
        It is likely that the Metaverse will give users the opportunity to earn
        new streams of income. Currently, &apos;play-to-earn games&apos; like
        Axie Infinity give users the opportunity to earn income within virtual
        worlds. Cryptocurrency income earned through play-to-earn games is taxed
        based on the asset’s fair market value at the time of receipt. Those
        working solely in the Metaverse can also be taxed on their personal
        income. Donating or auctioning off NFTs for charitable purposes is not
        considered to be a taxable event. In some cases, any relevant expenses
        related to operating in the Metaverse in the course of trade can be
        written off as a business expense. Net profits that are earned by
        Metaverse businesses will be subject to income tax. If you are operating
        a Metaverse business, you should consider keeping your personal and
        business wallets separate, this can make it easier to calculate your
        personal and business tax liabilities.
        <br />
        Indirect tax raises a number of other unanswered issues in the
        Metaverse. For instance, should the purchase of a plot of NFT real
        estate in the Metaverse using cryptocurrencies be subject to tax.
        <br />
        <br />
        The challenges involved in taxation include:
      </p>
      <ul className={`${styles.UnorderedListContainer} ${styles.NoPadding}`}>
        <li>
          Even after determining who, what, where, and to which authority taxes
          are owed, determining the tax base can present another challenge. If
          you pay in cryptocurrency, for example, the time-of-sale value and
          date-of-sale value may differ widely — so how can exchanges be valued
          in the metaverse?
        </li>
        <li>
          Transactions will involve avatars from different jurisdictions, and
          questions may arise about where the sale took place and which country
          can tax it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className={`${styles.Text} mt-[2rem]`}>
        Assuming you use a metaverse platform owned by a company in Germany to
        hire a specialist in Taiwan to virtually assist in the repair of your
        wind turbine off the Florida coast, which authorities can impose taxes?
        Also, similar issues may arise as to transactions occurring wholly
        within a country, where various states and cities may want to collect
        taxes.
        <br />
        <br />
        It is high time for all governments — state, federal, and foreign — to
        provide regulations as to how such ventures should be taxed, be it
        transaction taxes, income taxes, or any other category. The Organization
        for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is now working to
        develop a universal framework for Crypto taxes in an effort to foster
        agreement among jurisdictions.

      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        <span> Osborne&apos;s 10th Concise Law Dictionary </span>
        defines a right as an interest recognized and protected by the law.
        <br />
        Are human rights protected in the virtual world? History and experience
        suggest, the virtualization of human interaction increases the risk of
        anti-social behaviours that infringe on others’ human rights.
        <br />
        These new technologies also create new avenues for online harassment and
        abuse. AR glasses highly undermine expectations of privacy in both
        private and public spaces. For example, a person wearing AR glasses can
        easily record their surroundings in secret, which only becomes more
        dangerous if surveillance technologies such as facial recognition are
        incorporated in the AR device.
        <br />
        Other examples of Human Rights with high risk of violation in the
        virtual world are the right to dignity of the human person, freedom of
        movement, (this could be violated both by a metaverse platform or by a
        fellow avatar deliberately restricting the movement of another avatar),
        the right to join any social or religious group of one&apos;s choice
        (obnoxious conditions may be imposed to exclude some persons from
        membership in some Metaverse platforms and groups) etc. Majority of the
        avatars are humans, and humans deserve the same rights in a virtual
        world as they are afforded in the physical world. A human operating an
        avatar has the right to feel safe and secure. They have the right to be
        free from discrimination.
        <br />
        It took most governments some time to fully recognize the risk of online
        violence, cyberbullying, harassment, and indoctrination that came with
        the last iteration of the internet. In a virtual and more anonymous
        world, these risks will likely become more acute and potentially more
        difficult to manage.
        <br />
        Human rights standards are needed to be placed at the centre of
        developments in the virtual world to ensure that rights are not only
        respected, but indeed extended, in the metaverse.
        <br />
        There is a need for appropriate regulation and enforcement to protect
        people’s privacy and other human rights in the metaverse. Also, there is
        a need to nurture the grassroots, rights-respecting tech being developed
        today.
        <br />
        Users have the right to be clear on who has access to their data,
        including data shared as part of one’s terms of employment or school
        enrolment, and platforms should adopt strong transparency policies. It
        is necessary that nations ensure that Human Rights are protected through
        the enforcement of the{" "}

      <NumberedText text="DECEPTIVE DESIGN (DARK) PATTERNS  REGULATIONS" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        Deceptive design patterns (also known as &quot;dark patterns&quot;) are
        tricks used in websites and applications that lure unsuspecting
        individuals into purchasing goods or sign up for various things. The
        term “dark patterns” was first introduced by Brignull in 2010.
        <br />
        The following are various definitions of dark patterns by various
        scholars. According to Mathur, dark patterns involve coercion, steering,
        or deception. The{" "}
        <span>National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL)</span>
        glossary defines dark patterns as misleading user interfaces that are
        carefully designed to trick users into making choices, they may not be
        aware of or may not want to make. There is a risk of the use of dark
        patterns by companies in the virtual world. For example, the centralized
        metaverse platforms might have an unfair advantage over the users (and
        potential competitors), by making it compulsory for users to give
        personal information before joining the platforms. Dark patterns can
        range from subtle omissions to outright lies, but what they all have in
        common is that they undermine the users’ intentions and cost them time
        or money they had never planned to spend.
        <br />
        There is now a growing movement to ban dark patterns, and this may lead
        to consumer protection laws and actions. For example, in the United
        states, California is currently tackling dark patterns in its evolving
        privacy laws, and Washington’s latest privacy bill includes a provision
        about dark patterns. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), an agency of
        the United States, has enacted some provisions that prohibits “unfair or
        deceptive” commercial practices.
        <span> Section 5(a) of the FTC Act</span> provides that “unfair or
        deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce are declared
        unlawful.” Also, in Nigeria, the{" "}
        <span>
          Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Act (FCCPA) 2018
        </span>{" "}
        applies to regulate the use of dark patterns. These provisions are an
        expansion of the Consumer Privacy laws in these nations.
        <br />
        Fortunately, an advantage of the Metaverse with regard to deceptive
        patterns is that companies employing tactics to get users to relinquish
        their user information, buy products they don’t want, or sign up for
        services they might not otherwise make use of, would have a tough time.
        This is because in the metaverse through 3D technology, consumers would
        have real-time experience interacting with products before purchasing
        them.

        attacked Amazon alongside Apple and Google for allowing kids games on

        children to rack up multiple charges just by playing the game. Lastly,
        the enactment of legislation to curb the use of dark patterns by
        companies in the virtual world is necessary, so that consumers can use

      <NumberedText text="9. TRANS-BOUNDARY DISPUTE RESOLUTION IN  THE METAVERSE" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        For the purpose of this article, attention will be given to
        Jurisdictional differences, regulation and more extensively
        trans-boundary dispute resolution in the metaverse.
        <br />
        Now, here comes the million-dollar question, what is the Jurisdictional
        difference? In relation to the metaverse, it refers to territorial
        contrast existing between users of the metaverse, which results in
        giving people different perspectives of the metaverse because countries
        have different rules and laws.
        <br />
        These territorial contrasts often create problems especially with regard
        to laws of internet usage. For example, before the advent of the
        metaverse various countries developed distinctive guidelines on internet
        usage. In China, the use of prominent social media platforms like
        Facebook and Instagram are prohibited. Instead, they developed their own
        social media platforms like Baidu and WeChat.
        <br />
        The different laws and policies regarding the internet give a
        perspective of the way each country would regulate the metaverse. This
        might be the biggest barrier to achieving an interoperable Metaverse.

        <li>
          <span>Terms & conditions (T & Cs):</span> Decentralised & centralised
          platforms alike provide terms & conditions of use. Once a user signs
          up on the platform, these terms and conditions serve as guide lines in
          the determination of the liabilities of all the parties involved as
          well as the dispute resolution mechanisms available. There is a
          likelihood that the choice of forum clauses in each Metaverse
          platform&apos;s T&Cs might vary. For example, Decentraland’s T&Cs
          require disputes to be resolved under the arbitration rules of the
          International Chamber of Commerce, with the arbitration seat in
          Panama. Sandbox has a jurisdiction clause in favour of the Hong Kong
          courts. Meanwhile, Roblox’s terms and conditions contain an express
          waiver of class actions and require all US citizens to submit to
          arbitration under the AAA rules. The terms and conditions of Metaverse
          platforms are often in standard form which leaves users with limited
          options. As regards financial claims against platforms, in cases where
          a financial claim clause was not included in the T&C, there is a
          probability that the users would opt for the most favourable forum,
          thereby engaging forum shopping. This pattern has already began to
          show up in courts cases. In And v Reliantco Investments Ltd [2019]
          EWHC 879 a user of a cryptocurrency platform relied on the Brussels
          Regulation to ask the English court to disregard the platform&apos;s
          standard terms, which gave Cypriot courts exclusive jurisdiction. The
          court in that case concluded the user was a consumer under the
          Brussels Regulation and entitled to bring her claim in England. Users
          may start to expect stronger guarantees regarding the treatment of
          their assets and more benevolent conflict resolution clauses if and
          when they begin to invest more money into the Metaverse. While a user
          would mostly have no negotiating power in this respect, businesses
          contemplating investing in a specific Metaverse platform might demand
          the reviewing of the platform&apos;s T & C, which would encourage
          investment into that platform.

          <span>Resolution by DAO:</span> Decentralised Autonomous Organization
          (DAO) is a type of organisation that operates on blockchain technology
          and is run by smart contracts. It is essentially a decentralised
          organisation that is not controlled by any central authority or
          government. In the Metaverse, DAOs can play a significant role in
          governance and decision making processes. However, as with any
          organisation, disputes can arise between members or participants in a
          DAO. In such cases, the DAO may have its own dispute resolution
          mechanism in place and it can be built into the smart contracts
          governing the DAO. For instance, the smart contracts can include
          clauses providing for an internal dispute resolution in cases of
          disputes between members of the DAO. One potential advantage of
          including an internal resolution clause is that it can be faster, more
          exclusive, and more cost-effective. Additionally, the use of smart
          contracts can provide transparency and security in the resolution
          process. However, it is important for DAOs to ensure that their
          internal dispute resolution mechanism is fair, impartial, and provides
          adequate protection for all parties involved. This can be achieved
          through careful drafting of the smart contracts, involving experienced
          members in the resolution team and neutral third parties in the
          resolution process. Therefore, it is fair to say that international
          arbitration has already made its way into the brand-new virtual market
          and is set to take over as the preferred means of resolving disputes
          between users and platforms in the metaverse.

        <li>
          <span>On the Chain Arbitration:</span> On the chain arbitration is
          currently in use in many decentralised dispute resolution platforms
          such as Aragon, Jur & Kleros. These platforms perform fully automatic
          virtual procedures, after a disagreement has been filed, a reward is
          then given out in a smart contract immediately on the blockchain. Some
          of these platforms attach their pay-outs to escrow accounts, into
          which the parties must deposit a specific quantity of cryptocurrency
          before receiving their rewards. Currently, the &apos;on the chain
          arbitration&apos; system is only capable of awarding money. These
          decentralised courts use a panel of judges which are then compensated
          via blockchain to adjudicate conflicts. For instance, in Kleros,
          chosen judges are informed that they have been appointed, along with
          any supporting documentation, and are given three days to submit their
          ruling based on a constrained set of smart contract choices, such as
          &quot;Reimburse Claimant&quot; or &quot;Extend Contract
          Deadline&quot;. Following that, the smart contract enforces decisions
          on-chain. The arbitrators in these decentralised tribunals are
          encouraged to choose the most logical course of action. A bigger group
          of arbitrators may also hear appeals of decisions (with a commensurate
          increase in the fees, which are paid by the appealing party). By
          employing the technique of &apos;on the chain dispute
          resolution&apos;, users are assured of justice.

        In conclusion, these are the avenues currently available for
        transboundary dispute resolution and as time runs its course more
        avenues will come into existence.{" "}

        <span>Black’s Law Dictionary</span>
        defines Litigation as a judicial controversy. It is also a contest in a
        court of justice, for the purpose of enforcing a right. This leads to
        the question whether legal actions can be initiated against an avatar in
        the metaverse? Also do courts have jurisdiction to entertain claims of
        acts and omissions committed in the virtual world? It is obvious that
        some jurisdictions would adapt easily to holding claims in the
        metaverse, while it may be a struggle for other jurisdictions. It is
        believed that there would be slower adoption on the part of developing
        nations. Already, legal actions have been taken against the theft of
        virtual property in many countries, such as Japan, South Korea, and the
        Netherlands.
        <br />
        <br /> Infact, some nations have begun holding court sessions in the
        Metaverse. A Colombian court hosted its first legal trial in the
        metaverse at the two-hour hearing held by Colombia&apos;s Magdalena
        Administrative court, participants in a traffic dispute appeared as
        avatars in a virtual courtroom. As such, the country emerged as the
        first to test real legal hearings in the metaverse globally.

      <TopText text="CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        Beyond the buzz, there are real legal implications in the AI-Metaverse
        relationship. Contravening the law would most likely have legal
        consequences. Thus, the virtual world is not a haven to carry out
        illegal activities. The law is equally indispensable in the virtual
        world. However, there is a lacuna in the law with regard to the virtual
        world today. It is recommended that lawmakers around the world review
        the existing laws and regulations for the law to take its full course in
        the virtual world. Seeing that this would involve modifying a wide range
        of laws and policies. To ensure the implementation of these reviewed
        laws, it is not clear whether this is the obligation of each nation or
        that of the Metaverse platform. Finally, it is recommended that users
        and companies consult a lawyer for better guidance, as to the legal
        implications regarding the virtual world.
