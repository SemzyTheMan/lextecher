        How does Cyber Security relate to Data Privacy

          The strong connection between cybersecurity and data privacy is
          evident, with cybersecurity protecting against unauthorized access and
          data privacy ensuring control over personal information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Integrating data protection and cybersecurity is vital for a
          comprehensive strategy for safeguarding data. This synergy enhances
          cybersecurity effectiveness, preventing unauthorized accessâ€”a common
          entry point for major breaches.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          The intrinsic link between privacy and security is emphasized by
          privacy regulations mandating businesses to secure personal
          information. Failure to protect privacy results in severe penalties,
          damages consumer confidence, and harms a brand&apos;s reputation. The
          evolving threat landscape underscores the importance of a robust
          relationship between privacy and security within enterprises.

      <TopText text="THE ESSENCE OF THE CONNECTION" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        Data is considered a commodity online and offline by both legal and
        illegal actors. For this reason, data is a primary target of
        cybercriminals. Data also plays an integral role in the commission of
        many cybercrimes, primarily because it is not adequately protected and
        can be illicitly accessed and obtained.
        <br />
        Data breaches have resulted from lost or stolen encrypted flash drives
        and other storage devices (mainly laptop and smartphones), poor system
        and data security, unauthorized access to the database or the exceeding
        of authorized access to a database, and accidental disclosure, release
        or publication of data.
        <br />
        <br />
        Cybercrime violates individuals&apos; privacy and the security of their
        data, particularly hacking, malware, identity theft, financial fraud,
        medical fraud, and certain offenses against persons that involve the
        revealing of personal information, messages, images, video and audio
        recordings without individuals&apos; consent or permission (e.g.
        cyberstalking, cyberharassment, and cyberbullying

      <TopText text="WHAT IS DATA PROTECTION?" />
      <p className={`${styles.Text}`}>
        Data protection encompasses three main aspects: customary data
        protection (including backup and restore functions), data security, and
        data privacy. The methods and technologies constituting data protection
        mechanisms aim to secure data while considering the relationship with
        technology, public opinion, and legal circumstances.

        <li>
          Cybersecurity tools, such as a VPN (virtual private network), can
          enhance privacy and security. For instance, a VPN acts as a secure
          tunnel for data, encrypting online activities to protect user privacy
          and providing a defense against potential security threats.
        </li>
        <li>
          Encryption and secure access controls are crucial for preserving data
          confidentiality, integrity, and availability in the digital era.
        </li>
        <li>
          Also, individuals have a burden to secure their data and minimize
          their digital footprint.
